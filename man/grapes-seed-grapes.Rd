\usage{
fassignment \%seed\% seed
}
\arguments{
\item{fassignment}{The future assignment, e.g.
\code{x \%<-\% { expr }}.}

\item{seed}{(optional) If TRUE, the random seed, that is, the state of the
random number generator (RNG) will be set such that statistically sound
random numbers are produced (also during parallelization).
If FALSE (default), it is assumed that the future expression does neither
need nor use random numbers generation.
To use a fixed random seed, specify a L'Ecuyer-CMRG seed (seven integer)
or a regular RNG seed (a single integer).
Furthermore, if FALSE, then the future will be monitored to make sure it
does not use random numbers.  If it does and depending on the value of
option \code{\link[=future.options]{future.rng.onMisUse}}, the check is
ignored, an informative warning, or error will be produced.
If \code{seed} is NULL, then the effect is as with \code{seed = FALSE}
but without the RNG check being performed.}
