#' Create a remote future whose value will be resolved asynchronously in a remote process
#'
#' A remote future is a future that uses remote cluster evaluation,
#' which means that its _value is computed and resolved
#' remotely in another process_.
#'
#' @inheritParams ClusterFuture-class
#' @inheritParams multiprocess
#' @inheritParams Future-class
#' @inheritParams future
#' 
#' @param myip The external IP address of this machine.
#' If NULL, then it is inferred using an online service (default).
#'
#' @return A \link{ClusterFuture}.

#' @section 'remote' versus 'cluster':
#' The `remote` plan is a very similar to the [`cluster`] plan, but provides
#' more convenient default argument values when connecting to remote machines.  Specifically,
#' `remote` uses `persistent = TRUE` by default, and it sets `homogeneous`,
#' `revtunnel`, and `myip` "wisely" depending on the value of `workers`.
#' See below for example on how `remote` and `cluster` are related.
#'
#' The preferred way to create an cluster future is not to call
#' this function directly, but to register it via
#' \code{\link{plan}(remote)} such that it becomes the default
#' mechanism for all futures.  After this [future()]
#' and \code{\link{\%<-\%}} will create _cluster futures_.
