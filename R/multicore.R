#' Create a multicore future whose value will be resolved asynchronously in a forked parallel process
#'
#' A multicore future is a future that uses multicore evaluation,
#' which means that its _value is computed and resolved in
#' parallel in another process_.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is _not_ meant to be called directly.  Instead, the
#' typical usages are:
#'
#' ```r
#' # Evaluate futures in parallel on the local machine via as many forked
#' # processes as available to the current R process
#' plan(multicore)
#'
#' # Evaluate futures in parallel on the local machine via two forked processes
#' plan(multicore, workers = 2)
#' ```
#'
#' @inheritParams multiprocess
#' @inheritParams Future-class
#' @inheritParams future
#'
#' @return A \link{MulticoreFuture}
#' If `workers == 1`, then all processing using done in the
#' current/main \R session and we therefore fall back to using
#' an sequential future.  This is also the case whenever multicore
#' processing is not supported, e.g. on Windows.
#'
#' @example incl/multicore.R
#'
#' @details
#' For the total number of cores available including the current/main
#' \R process, see [parallelly::availableCores()].
#'
#' Not all operating systems support process forking and thereby not multicore
#' futures.  For instance, forking is not supported on Microsoft Windows.
#' Moreover, process forking may break some R environments such as RStudio.
#' Because of this, the future package disables process forking also in
#' such cases.  See [supportsMulticore()] for details.
#' Trying to create multicore futures on non-supported systems or when
#' forking is disabled will result in multicore futures falling back to
#' becoming [sequential] futures.
#'
#' @seealso
#' For processing in multiple background \R sessions, see
#' [multisession] futures.
#'
#' Use [availableCores()] to see the total number of
#' cores that are available for the current \R session.
#' Use \code{\link{availableCores}("multicore") > 1L} to check
#' whether multicore futures are supported or not on the current
#' system.
