Got a question about futures or the future framework?  Is there something that doesn't work as you expected?  Are you stuck?  If so, please post to our the dedicated Discussions Forum instead:

  https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/discussions

If you think you've detected a bug or got a feature request, please go back to 'Issues' and select the corresponding type of issue.

Thank you,

Henrik
