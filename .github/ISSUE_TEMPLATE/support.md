Got a question about futures or the future framework?  Is there something that doesn't work as you expected?  Are you stuck?  If so, **please post your question on the dedicated [Discussions Forum](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/discussions) instead.**

If you think you've detected a bug or got a feature request, please go back to [Issues](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues) and select the corresponding type of issue.

Thank you,

Henrik
