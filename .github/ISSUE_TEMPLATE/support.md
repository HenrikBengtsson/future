Got a question about futures or the future framework?  Is there something that doesn't work as you expected?  Are you stuck?  Experiencing problems installing one of the future packages?  If so, please post to our the dedicated Discussions Forum instead:

  https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/discussions

If you think you've detected a bug or got a feature request, please go back to 'Issues' and select the corresponding type of issue.

Thank you,

Henrik
